# AirBnB Clone

## Description

The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from our console code (the command interpreter itself)

## How to start it

1. Clone the repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Salma-Mahmoudd/AirBnB_clone.git
```

2. Then start the console by running the following command:

```bash
$ ./console.py
```

## How to use it

The console works both in interactive mode and non-interactive mode. To start the console in interactive mode, run the following coomand:

```bash
>>> ./console.py
```
to create a new instance:
example
```bash
$ create BaseModel
```
to delete an instance write `destroy <class name> <class id>`
to show the string representation of an instance `show <class name> <class id>`
to update an instance `update <class name> <id> <attribute name> <attribute value>`
